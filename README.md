# Lightning Talk Watch 2

A stop watch counting time, giving a visual and accoustic signal when time expired and then counting up, giving a second signal when the next timelimit exceeded.

## Intention

there was no suitable app on the net oder app store to suite what I needed to host lightning talks.  
So I wrote that little PWA (so it can run offline as well in case of bad internet) to fit that niche.  
This code is back from 2018 when I was quite new to Angular, but I took the time to upgrade to the lastest Angular version at the given time.  
Maybe I will rewrite some of the code to be more Angular style, but feel free to do so.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
